  # The Basic Image Editor

  Hello! I vibe coded this very basic image editor in Figma Make (with Gemini3) to solve my need of having quick edits for those small everyday needs. I really liked the Windows Photos Editor but I missed something similar when I moved to MacOS which is why I created this online solution.

  I would encourage folks to help me refine it and build on it so that we make it one of the best free and open-source basic image editors on the planet. Simple, Fast & Efficient.

  The original project is available at https://www.figma.com/design/W6PozHb7rYNUKop0AH7DiK/Basic-Image-Editor.

  ## Running the code

  Run `npm i` to install the dependencies.

  Run `npm run dev` to start the development server.
